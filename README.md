# segway_sim

This is a ROS-based C++ simulation environment for a two-wheeled inverted pendulum (Segway) robot. It currently has two branches, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) branch that uses a Mixed Observable Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) planner for high-level planning, and uses the MPC for trajectory generation and control. The other branch is a Control Barrier Function (CBF) branch that guarantees that the system stays in a "safe" subset of the state space, regardless of the inputs given to the system from the user.

### Prerequisites

Eigen is required. If Eigen is not installed, or you want to run the version of Eigen that runs on the Segway, use the Eigen_embedded folder and replace all instances of Eigen_embedded with Eigen.

The OSQP solver is used for both branches, and can be found [here](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp)

The MPC branch requires the following [library](https://github.com/urosolia/multirate-mpc-cbf) for MPC, as well as the following ROS [package](https://github.com/DrewSingletary/ambercortex_ros) for its message structure.

CBF branch installation coming soon.

## Description

### The robot
The simulation is based on the Ninebot Elite used in the AMBER lab [link](http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/). The code run in this simulation environment has been used directly on the hardware, as evidenced in this [![video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Tr6bpjmzHcE/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Tr6bpjmzHcE)

### How to run
Coming soon

## Results
Coming soon
